Titanium
========

Titanium is an open-source php scaffold. I know there are a bunch of different ones out there but I don't like any of those. So here is my own. You can add and subtract any of the different modules in `modules/`. Look in the `app/` directory for an example of how your app would function. It's pretty cool.

## Under Construction
This framework is very much still in development but you can watch its progress here and contribute if you would like!
